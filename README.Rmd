## Overview

`entrainment` is a rule-based model created on Python to test and to demonstrate the 24h light/dark cycle [entrainment phenomenon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entrainment_(chronobiology)).

## Prerequisites

You need to have some familiarity with the [Python programming language](https://www.python.org/) to use `entrainment` main functions.

In case you don't feel comfortable with Python, we strongly recommend checking Jake VanderPlas free and online book [Python Data Science Handbook](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/) and the Coursera course from Google [Crash Course on Python](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-crash-course) (free for audit students).

## Installation

You can install `entrainment` from GitHub with:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/danielvartan/entrainment.git#egg=entrainment
```

We don't intend to publish this package on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/).

## Usage

The following example illustrates how to run the model.

Please note that in this example all of the model arguments are assigned. You don't need to assign values to all arguments, you can just use the default values. Check [`run_model()`](https://entrainment.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference.html#entrainment.run_model) documentation to learn more.

```{python}
#| label = "setup-python",
#| include = FALSE

import numpy as np

np.random.seed(1000)
```

```{python}
#| label = "usage-example",
#| fig.alt = "24h light/dark cycle entrainment of a population located at the south of Brazil by season"

import entrainment

turtles = entrainment.run_model(
    n = 10**3, # Number of subjects/turtles to create
    tau_range = (23.5, 24.6), # Limits for assigning 'Tau' values
    tau_mean = 24.15, # Mean value for the 'Tau' distribution
    tau_sd = 0.2, # Standard deviation value for the 'Tau' distribution
    k_range = (0.001, 0.01), # Limits for assigning the 'k' values
    k_mean = 0.001, # Mean value for the 'k' distribution
    k_sd = 0.005, # Standard deviation value for the 'k' distribution
    lam_c = 3750, # Critical 'lambda' value
    labren_id = 1, # LABREN id of the global horizontal irradiation means
    by = "season", # Series resolution (choices: "month", "season", "year")
    n_cycles = 3, # Number of cycles to run
    start_at = 0, # Index number indicating the start of the series
    repetitions = 10**2, # Number of repetitions
    plot = True # Boolean value indicating if the function must plot the results
    )
```

You can learn more about the available functions going to the [package documentation website](https://entrainment.readthedocs.io).

## Citation

If you use `entrainment` in your research, please consider citing it. We put a
lot of work to build and maintain a free and open-source Python package. You
