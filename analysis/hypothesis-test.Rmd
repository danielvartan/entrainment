# Latitude hypothesis test

The following topics show the basic steps for testing the latitude hypothesis using the `entrainment` model.

> Hypothesis statement: Populations residing close to the equator (latitude 0°) (i.e., with greater average insolation) have, on average, a shorter duration/morning circadian phenotype when compared to populations residing near the planet's poles (i.e., with lower average insolation) ([Leocadio-Miguel et al., 2017](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-017-05797-w); [Roenneberg et al., 2003](https://doi.org/10.1177/0748730402239679)).

The latitude hypothesis is based on the idea that regions located at latitudes close to the poles have, on average, a lower incidence of annual sunlight when compared to regions close to the equator (latitude 0°).

```{r}
#| label = "Pidwirny (2019) (Figure 6i-3)",
#| fig.cap = "Monthly values of available insolation in Wm-2 for the equator (0°), 30°, 60°, and 90° North.",
#| out.width = "75%",
#| echo = FALSE

Thus, it is understood by deduction that the regions close to the equator have a stronger solar [zeitgeber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeitgeber), which, according to theory, should generate a greater propensity for synchronizing the circadian rhythms of these populations to the light-dark cycle, reducing the amplitude and the diversity of circadian phenotypes. This would also give these populations a morning characteristic when compared to populations living far from the equator, in which the opposite would occur, i.e., a greater amplitude and diversity of circadian phenotypes and an evening characteristic when compared to populations living near the equator. ([Roenneberg et al., 2003](https://doi.org/10.1177/0748730402239679)).

## 1. Do the initial setup

```{python}
import entrainment
```

## 2. Run the model for both groups

### By season

```{python}
#| label = "plot_labren"
#| include = FALSE

entrainment.labren(id = 72272, by = "season")
entrainment.plot_labren(by = "season")
```

```{python}
#| echo = TRUE

n = 10**3
lam_c = 3750
n_cycles = 3
repetitions = 10**2
x_name = "Nascente do rio Ailã"
y_name = "Arroio Chuí"
```

* North group (Location: Nascente do Rio Ailã) (Latitude: 5.272)

```{python}
#| label = "run_north_by_season",
#| results = FALSE

north_by_season = entrainment.run_model(
    n = n, labren_id = 72272, by = "season", lam_c = lam_c, n_cycles = n_cycles,
    repetitions = repetitions
    )
```

* South group (Location: Arroio Chuí) (Latitude: -33.752)

```{python}
#| label = "run_south_by_season",
#| results = FALSE

south_by_season = entrainment.run_model(
    n = n, labren_id = 1, by = "season", lam_c = lam_c, n_cycles = n_cycles,
    repetitions = repetitions
    )
```

### By year

* North group (Location: Nascente do Rio Ailã) (Latitude: 5.272)

```{python}
#| label = "run_north_by_year",
#| results = FALSE

north_by_year = entrainment.run_model(
    n = n, labren_id = 72272, by = "year", lam_c = lam_c, n_cycles = n_cycles,
    repetitions = repetitions
    )
```

* South group (Location: Arroio Chuí) (Latitude: -33.752)

```{python}
#| label = "run_south_by_year",
#| results = FALSE

south_by_year = entrainment.run_model(
    n = n, labren_id = 1, by = "year", lam_c = lam_c, n_cycles = n_cycles,
    repetitions = repetitions
    )
```
