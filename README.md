## Overview

`entrainment` is a rule-based model created on Python to test and demonstrate the 24h light/dark cycle entrainment phenomenon.

This model was initially created for the class "SCX5002 - Complex System I" of the Graduate Program in Modeling Complex Systems (PPG-SCX) of the University of Sao Paulo (USP) under the guidance of Prof. Dr. Camilo Rodrigues Neto.
